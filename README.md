# Spotify Playlist Utilities Collection

This project is an on-again-off-again side project to provide a way to host different Spotify playlist experiments with a web UI.

## Duplicate Tracks are Weird

The main motivation for putting this together is a really obscure and annoying issue with the way music is hosted on Spotify.

Namely, songs can have many identical versions each with its own unique ID different from all the other previous versions. Playlists that have been edited, listened to, and otherwise enjoyed for several years may accumulate multiple versions of the same track since Spotify uses these unique IDs to detect duplicates.

You might not notice the issue until you've heard the same song three times in a row in a playlist with 750 songs.

To make matters even more fun, songs on Spotify may have many versions with slightly different names: "Cool Song", "Cool Song - Remastered 1998", "Cool Song - Remastered 2024", or "Cool Song (Remix)" can all be in the same playlist without Spotify batting an eye and may very well sound identical (thanks music industry)!

I wanted a way to identify all these duplicates automatically and let me choose which ones I wanted to keep in the playlist. So **pluc** was born!

## Future Work

While the duplicate detection band-aid was the main motivation behind this project, and pluc's only current feature, I plan on adding more playlist utilities to pluc as I find both the time and motivation.

Luckily Spotify is typically a pretty great service so I'm not annoyed by much else other than this problem at the moment, but rest assured I'll find something else to complain about and push to this repo.

If you have any suggestions for other utilities please feel free to hit me up, I'm always down to work with someone as obsessive over their playlists as I am!
